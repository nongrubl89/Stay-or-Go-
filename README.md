This app is designed to help decide whether it is cost effective for a business aircraft to stay overnight at an airport away from its homebase. Users can input the following:

    -current ICAO and FBO
    -number of nights in current location
    -number of crew members
    -homebase ICAO and FBO
    -next destination
    -type of aircraft

The app will then calculate the cost of staying in the current location vs the cost of flying the aircraft back to homebase.

I'll use a server stub to emulate an API that will populate fuel price and cost per hour of aircraft.
